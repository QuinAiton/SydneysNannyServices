            My name is Sydney Hill and I am currently living in Pemberton, BC.
            In the spring of 2021, I graduated from Simon Fraser University with
            a bachelor of general studies in Education, with the end goal of
            becoming an elementary school teacher. I have a triple minor in
            Early Learning, Curriculum and Development, and Geography. I have
            worked at Early Childhood Education centreâ€™s and prior to this I
            worked as a lifeguard/swim instructor for 7 years. I am certified
            with my standard first aid CPR C/AED, national lifeguard service,
            and water safety instructor. I am constantly looking to gain more
            knowledge about the world around me so I can become the best
            educator and mentor I can be. When I am not surrounded by children,
            I love being outside, mountain biking, hiking and swimming in the
            summer and skiing in the winter.
